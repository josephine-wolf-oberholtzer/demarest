\textit{\noindent You know how it is when your mind enters into a silence with
the land? when you give up speaking, and you give up listening for gulls or
watching for a shift in the weather, and just begin to place yourself in the
world? That was how it was when I was up on the bow stalk looking for the
wreckage of the {\normalfont Migremo}. Long patches of ruffled water, families
of the great silver-backed balenoj going up to their wintering place in the By
Far fjord; squalls of rain shadowing the sea; rafts of flag-dippers, gray-green
against the gray-green water, the yellow bills of those seabirds seeming to
slide like a scurf of petals on the water: I recognized and understood these
pattern of light in a dreamy unvoiced way while I waited for my eye to take in
what was not of the land -- floating plastic, aluminum, the suflated exo of a
dead person -- and say it to me on a breath, like a word spoken aloud --
{\normalfont There}.
